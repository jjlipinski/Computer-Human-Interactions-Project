**Team Name:** LJL

**Team Members:** Lizy Hoepfinger, Lindsey Sperrey, Jessica Lipinski

**Problem of Study:** There is a reduction of in-class feedback, and it is more difficult to review topics discussed in class because students canâ€™t review recorded zoom lectures anymore. With the return of face to face instruction, students now lack the affordances of being able to rewatch recorded lectures and have online discussions.
