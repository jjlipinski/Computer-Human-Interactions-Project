Team LJL’s project by Lizy Hoepfinger, Jessica Lipinski, and Lindsey Sperrey (“we” or “us” or “our”), including any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application related or connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”), may contain copyrighted material, the use of which may not have been specifically authorized by the copyright owner. This material is used for a project done by us for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), a course taught at the University of Georgia.

Site content is distributed without profit for educational purposes. Only small portions of original, copyrighted works are being used without explicit authorization and those could not be used easily to duplicate the original works. This should constitute a “fair use” of any such copyrighted material (referenced and provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law). If a user (“user” or “you”) wishes to use any copyrighted material from this site for purposes of their own that go beyond “fair use”, then they must obtain expressed permission from the current copyright owner.
